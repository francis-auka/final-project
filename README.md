### Backend Services
- **Supabase** as Backend-as-a-Service providing:
  - PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security (RLS)
  - Real-time subscriptions for live updates
  - Authentication and user management
  - File storage for profile pictures and documents
  - Edge functions for serverless backend logic

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
- **profiles**: User information and verification status
- **hustles**: Task posts with offers, deadlines, and status
- **bids**: Competitive offers from users on tasks
- **chat_messages**: Real-time messaging between users
- **payment_intents**: Transaction tracking and payment processing

#### Security Features
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Ensures users can only access their own data
- **Authentication Integration**: Seamless auth flow with profile creation
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **Secure File Uploads**: Protected storage for user documents

## üîß How It Works

### 1. User Onboarding & Authentication
1. **Registration**: New users sign up with email/password on `/register`
2. **Email Confirmation**: 
   - Supabase sends a confirmation email to the registered address
   - Users must click the confirmation link to activate their account
   - Account remains inactive until email is verified
3. **Profile Setup**: Complete profile with academic and personal information including:
   - Personal details (name, age, phone, gender)
   - Academic information (school, course, year of study)
   - School ID upload for student verification
4. **Login**: Once email is confirmed, users can log in at `/login`
5. **Trust Score**: Start with baseline trust score (3.0/5.0)

### 2. Task Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Users post tasks with detailed requirements
2. **Discovery**: Other users browse and search available tasks
3. **Bidding**: Interested users place competitive bids
4. **Assignment**: Task owner reviews and accepts best bid
5. **Execution**: Direct communication and work completion
6. **Payment**: Secure payment processing upon completion
7. **Rating**: Mutual rating system to build trust scores

### 3. Communication Flow
1. **Initial Contact**: Bidders can send introductory messages
2. **Task Assignment**: Dedicated chat channels open upon bid acceptance
3. **Progress Updates**: Real-time communication during task execution
4. **Completion**: Final confirmations and payment processing

### 4. Payment Processing
1. **Intent Creation**: Payment intents created upon task completion
2. **Secure Processing**: Multiple payment methods supported
3. **Status Tracking**: Real-time payment status updates
4. **Confirmation**: Automatic completion upon successful payment

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed
- Supabase account and project setup
- Environment variables configured

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd campus-hustle-hub

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Supabase URL and keys

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### Authentication Setup (Important)
For proper authentication flow:

1. **Supabase Configuration**:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication ‚Üí Settings
   - Set Site URL to your application URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
   - Add redirect URLs for both development and production
   - For development: `http://localhost:5173`
   - For production: your deployed URL

2. **Email Confirmation**:
   - By default, Supabase requires email confirmation
   - Users will receive a confirmation email after registration
   - To disable for testing: Go to Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí "Enable email confirmations" (toggle off)
   - **Recommended**: Keep email confirmation enabled for production

## üìä Database Setup

The application requires several Supabase tables with proper RLS policies. Run the provided SQL migrations to set up:

1. **User Profiles Table**: Store extended user information
2. **Hustles Table**: Main task/job postings
3. **Bids Table**: User bids on tasks
4. **Chat Messages Table**: Real-time messaging
5. **Payment Intents Table**: Payment processing

All tables include comprehensive Row Level Security policies to ensure data privacy and security.
